Welcome to  Python calculator project! The goal is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The task is to implement the code under calculator.py; we've provided placeholders for the functions. Our job is to write the body of those functions.
Basic Arithmetic Operations

# Add
# Subtract
# Multiply
# Divide 

We've set up 4 functions here that you need to finish. These are straightforward and should not pose too much trouble. Recall your lessons on basic operators in Python!

Functions to Implement:
- add(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.
- subtract(a, b): Returns the difference when b is subtracted from a.
- multiply(a, b): Returns the product of a and b.
- divide(a, b): Returns the result of dividing a by b. If b is 0, return a string warning the user not to divide by 0.

Exception Handling:
- In the divide(a, b) function, ensure that you handle the case where b is 0. Return an appropriate error message like "Invalid value for denominator, can't divide by 0!".
